# Draw basic signals

## Description :
1. First, we execute the cell related to adding the necessary libraries.
2. Draw the two cosine and exponential signals in the notebook with the given specifications.

## Sound summarization
1. We record our voice using our mobile phone voice recording software (up to two sentences).
2. Using the following site, we convert our file format to wav.

## 3. We read our sound file and draw its signal.

## 4. To summarize the sound, the points where there is no speech (the signal has no value) must be removed from the signal. To do this, it is suggested to remove values less than 30 from our signal data.

## 5. Draw the summarized signal.

(It is suggested to use Colab Google system to run notebooks for convenience.)
